 * Real implementation -- resolves the blocking cross-module dependency Admin's
 * AdminVendorKycController was built against (see Admin's NOTES_ADMIN.md). This was
 * meant to be built "when the Vendor round happens" -- it took two Vendor rounds
 * (catalog pivot, then delivery-dispatch) before this actually got built; flagging that
 * gap plainly rather than pretending it was planned this way. Replaces
 * VendorTestController's approve-kyc stand-in as the real review path.
 * VendorTestController is left in place, not deleted, until this is confirmed working
 * end-to-end against a real Admin UI.
