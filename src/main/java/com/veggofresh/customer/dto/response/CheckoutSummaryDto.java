 * PHASE 2 — BREAKING CHANGE from the Phase 1 shape (which was one flat
 * subtotal/total for a single cart). Now a per-cart breakdown plus a grand
 * total, since one checkout call can produce N independent orders.
 *
 * <p>Every number here is defined to be IDENTICAL to the corresponding field on
 * the cart screen ({@code CartResponseDto}) for the same address. The two
 * responses are two views of one calculation, and they used to disagree on item
 * counts and on which cart carried which label.
