/**
 * PHASE 2 — NEW ARCHITECTURE, multi-cart model (PROJECT_STATE section 2).
 *
 * A customer can have several concurrent OPEN carts. Each cart tracks the
 * set of vendors able to fulfil ALL of its items at once (its candidate-vendor
 * set). Adding an item picks the cart that maximises vendor overlap with that
 * item — best-fit, not first-fit, so an item never gets stranded in a worse
 * cart just because that cart was created earlier. If no existing cart can
 * share a vendor with the item, a new cart is created.
 *
 * Two invariants this service guarantees:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The candidate-vendor set is re-derived from the cart's items after
 *       every add, quantity change and removal, so it is never stale.</li>
 *   <li>A cart that is emptied is soft-deleted rather than left open, and
 *       empty carts are never returned. An open-but-empty cart used to be
 *       listed and labelled, which made two real carts appear as three.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * BREAKING CHANGE from Phase 1: every mutating method now returns the FULL
 * list of the user's open carts, not a single cart, since one call can
 * affect which cart an item lands in.
